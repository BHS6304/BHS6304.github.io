<br> <br> 
    
<p style="font-size: 24px;">On phones & small tablets, for people to easily see the list of Past Broadcasts, JavaScript code is needed. But due to some conflict in how our website is set up in WordPress, JS doesn't work properly as the player embed code. Our site is old and has not been updated in years. We have to use iframe code which works fine on laptops and computers but hides the Past Broadcast list behind the player window on phones and small tablets. The link on this page shows how the embedded player should look and work for people to easily find and view Past Broadcasts. It uses the updated code that Boxcast generates as of Feb. 2026. With only the embed code on a web page, the player and PB list display and work correctly using JS on all devices. The 2 main advantages of using the JS code are that we can choose how many PBs are listed per page, and that the PB list clearly displays on phones instead of being hidden. </p>

<p style="font-size: 24px;"> Meanwhile, any time you need to easily view or search the year's worth of PBs we have online, using this page makes it extremely easy. </p>
