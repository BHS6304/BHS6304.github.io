<p style="font-size: 24px;">On phones & small tablets, for people to easily see the list of previous recordings, JavaScript code is needed. But due to some conflict in our website code, JS doesn't work as the player embed code. We have to use iframe code which works fine on laptops and computers but hides the recording list behind the player window on phones and small tablets. A website pro could fix the problem. On this GitHub website, I made 2 bare pages with only the JS code. They both work. One page has the recording list to the right of the player window. The other has the list underneath. Another advantage of using the JS code is that we can choose how many recordings are listed per page. Check out the 2 links below to see it. </p>
