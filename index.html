<br> <br> 
    
<p style="font-size: 24px;">On phones & small tablets, for people to easily see the list of Past Broadcasts, JavaScript code is needed. But due to some conflict in how our website is set up in WordPress, JS doesn't work properly as the player embed code. Also our site is old and has not been updated in years. We have to use iframe code which works fine on laptops and computers but hides the Past Broadcast list behind the player window on phones and small tablets. The links on this page show how the embedded player could look and work for people to easily find and view Past Broadcasts. With just the embed code only, the player and PB list display and work correctly using JS. The 2 main advantages of using the JS code is that we can choose how many recordings are listed per page, and the PB list clearly displays on phones. </p>
