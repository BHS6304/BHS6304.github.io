<p style="font-size: 24px;">On phones & small tablets, for people to easily see the list of previous recordings, JavaScript code is needed. But due to some bug in our website code, JS doesn't work as the player embed code. We have to use iframe code which works fine on laptops and computers but hides the recording list behind the player window on phones and small tablets. To verify, use your phone to go to our live stream page. Then use your phone on the page at the link below and see the difference. A website pro could fix the problem. </p>
